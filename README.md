## Background
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a basic linear regression model's usage to predict salary based on years of experience. This can serve as a foundation for understanding more complex machine learning concepts.

## Prerequisites
- Python (3.6+)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn


## Usage
1. Prepare your data:
- Ensure you have a dataset with two columns: "Years of Experience" and "Salary".
2. Train the model:
- Run the `train_model.py` script to train the linear regression model on your data.
3. Make predictions:
- Use the trained model to predict salaries for different years of experience by running the `predict.py` script.

## Results
The linear regression model will output a simple equation that can be used to predict salaries based on years of experience. The accuracy of the predictions may vary depending on the dataset used and other factors.
